  Perfect for those who want to level up automatically or build massive pixel arts — without wasting time.
  
  Warning: This is a purely educational script to demonstrate what can be done on wplace.live, it is not our responsibility of what happens if you use the script.

  <sub><strong>It wasn't me who "hacked" WPlace and placed that giant Herobrine there...<br>
  But if you're wondering: yes! These scripts were made by a Brazilian and VietNamese. HUEHUE!</strong></sub>

<p align="center"><strong>🚀┃How to use the scripts:</strong></p>

<p align="center">
  It’s super easy: copy one of the codes below, paste it into your browser’s bookmarks bar,<br>
  and run it while you're on wplace.live.
</p>

<br>

### 🎯┃Auto-Farm
#### AUTOFARM USES CHARGES TO GET LEVELS, IT DOES NOT DRAW AN IMAGE FOR YOU. PLEASE USE AUTO-IMAGE FOR THAT
```js
javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wplace-AutoBot/WPlace-AutoBOT/refs/heads/dev/Auto-Farm.js").then(t=>t.text()).then(eval);
```

### 🖼️┃Auto-Image

```js
javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wplace-AutoBot/WPlace-AutoBOT/refs/heads/dev/Auto-Image.js").then(t=>t.text()).then(eval);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <p><sub><strong>1.</strong> None of the scripts will work if you close the browser tab. You must keep the WPlace tab open, even if it's in the background.</sub></p>
> <p><sub><strong>2.</strong> Never run both scripts on the same page — this can bug your WPlace. If it happens, just refresh the page!</sub></p>
> <p><sub><strong>3.</strong> If the script doesn’t detect the available colors, just click the "Paint" button to show them — only then start the Auto-Imager.</sub></p>
